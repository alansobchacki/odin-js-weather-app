Project: Weather App
=============

A basic weather forecast app that shows the weather for the next 3 days in a given city.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-js-weather-app/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the fifth project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [5/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Create a weather forecast site using the weather API.
- [x] Change the look of the page based on the data (I chose to use icons).
- [x] Write the functions that process the JSON data youâ€™re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- [x] Set up a form that will let users input their location and fetch the weather info.
- [x] Display the information on your webpage.

What I Learned
-----

This project was surprisingly quick. I thought that working with APIs would be harder (I spent more time toying with CSS than writing the whole API fetching logic). Then again, this was a simple project. 

I learned the basics of handling APIs (fetching data, inspecting JSONs, getting an API key, etc). I also learned about promises and asynchronous code.

Also, the API key isn't properly hidden. That's something to be handled in further backend lessons.
